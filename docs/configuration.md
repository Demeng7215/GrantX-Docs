## Upgrading
To upgrade your configuration files after an update containing config changes, click on the latest default of the file (above) and use an online diff tool or text comparer to see what has been added/removed/changed. Make the changes accordingly. Make sure you change your "config-version" to the newer version if you are upgrading manually. If you don't want to go through all of this hassle, you can delete your config file and restart your server to allow it to regenerate with the newest default.
