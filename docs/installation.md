# Installation
1. Download GrantX [here](https://demeng7215.com/grantx) after purchasing if you haven't already.
2. Move the JAR file to your server's "plugins" directory.
3. Install [Vault](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vault) and a permissions plugin supporting vault, such as [LuckPerms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/28140/) (recommended) or [PermissionsEx](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/permissionsex) and configure your ranks/groups in that plugin if you haven't already.
4. Restart your server.
5. Several files will be generated, including a logs folder, settings.yml, messages.yml, style.yml, ranks.yml, and data.yml.
6. Go to ranks.yml and follow the ExampleRank format to add your own ranks.
7. Go to settings.yml's "commands-executed-on" section and set everything up. Comments explain what to do.
8. Customize anything else (optional).
9. Restart or run the */grantx reload* command to activate your changes.
