# Installation

## Prerequisites
* Java 8 or above.
* Spigot or a Spigot-forked JAR such as Paper/TacoSpigot running anywhere between MC 1.8.x-1.15.x.
* Basic knowledge on how to operate Minecraft servers.

## Dependencies
* [Vault](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/vault)
* A permissions plugin supporting Vault, such as [LuckPerms](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/28140/) (recommended) or [PermissionsEx](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/permissionsex).

## Instructions
1. Download GrantX [here](https://demeng7215.com/grantx) after purchasing if you haven't already.
2. Move the JAR file to your server's "plugins" directory.
3. Install all dependencies and configure your groups in your permissions plugin if you haven't already.
4. Restart your server.
5. Several files will be generated, including a logs folder, settings.yml, messages.yml, style.yml, ranks.yml, and data.yml.
6. Go to ranks.yml and follow the ExampleRank format to add your own ranks.
7. Go to settings.yml's "commands-executed-on" section and set everything up. Comments explain what to do. These may be set up automatically already for you depending on what permissions plugin you are using.
8. Customize anything else (optional).
9. Restart or run the */grantx reload* command to activate your changes.
