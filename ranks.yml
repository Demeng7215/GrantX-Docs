# The list of ranks and permissions in the GUI.
ranks:
  # This is an example rank. All other ranks or permissions should copy this template.
  Example:
    # The type of grantable, can be either RANK or PERMISSION.
    type: RANK
    # Starts at 1, goes up to the GUI's last slot.
    # Set to -1 to not show this rank.
    # Set this to 0 for design type 1 and 2, to allow paging.
    slot: 0
    # The display name of this rank/permission in the GUIs and in chat messages.
    display-name: "&c&lExample"
    # The name of the rank (group) in your permissions plugin.
    # For permissions, this is the permission node.
    real-name: "example"
    # The description of the rank/perm, used in the %description% placeholder.
    # By default, this is not shown. You can change that in style.yml.
    description: "This is an example rank."
    # The material that represents this rank/perm in the GUIs.
    material: "WHITE_WOOL"
    # The rank/perm's priority.
    # The lower the priority, the earlier it shows in the rank selection GUI.
    # This is also used to determine the %next-best-group% placeholder.
    priority: 100
    # If this rank/perm is actually usable or just for aesthetics in the GUI.
    dummy: true
    # The permission required to grant this rank/perm.
    required-permission: "grant.examplerank"
